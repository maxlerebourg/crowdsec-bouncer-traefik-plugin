# Crowdsec Bouncer Traefik plugin

> New! This plugin now supports [AppSec](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/next/appsec/intro/) feature including virtual patching and capabilities support for your legacy ModSecurity rules.

This plugin aims to implement a Crowdsec Bouncer in a Traefik plugin.

> [CrowdSec](https://www.crowdsec.net/) is an open-source and collaborative IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and a security suite.
> We leverage local behavior analysis and crowd power to build the largest CTI network in the world.

The purpose is to enable Traefik to authorize or block requests from IPs based on their reputation and behavior.

The Crowdsec utility will provide the community blocklist which contains highly reported and validated IPs banned from the Crowdsec network.

When used with Crowdsec it will leverage the local API which will analyze Traefik logs and take decisions on the requests made by users/bots. Malicious actors will be banned based on patterns used against your website.

Appsec feature is supported from plugin version 1.2.0 and Crowdsec 1.6.0.

The AppSec Component offers:

- Low-effort virtual patching capabilities.
- Support for your legacy ModSecurity rules.
- Combining classic WAF benefits with advanced CrowdSec features for otherwise difficult advanced behavior detection.
More information on appsec in the [Crowdsec Documentation](https://doc.crowdsec.net/docs/next/appsec/intro/).


There are 4 operating modes (CrowdsecMode) for this plugin:

| Mode | Description |
|------|------|
| none | If the client IP is on ban list, it will get a http code 403 response. Otherwise, request will continue as usual. All request call the Crowdsec LAPI |
| live | If the client IP is on ban list, it will get a http code 403 response. Otherwise, request will continue as usual.    The bouncer can leverage use of a local cache in order to reduce the number of requests made to the Crowdsec LAPI. It will keep in cache the status for  each IP that makes queries. |
| stream | Stream Streaming mode allows you to keep in the local cache only the Banned IPs, every requests that does not hit the cache is authorized. Every minute, the cache is updated with news from the Crowdsec LAPI. |
| alone | Standalone mode, similar to the streaming mode but the blacklisted IPs are fetched on the CAPI. Every 2 hours, the cache is updated with news from the Crowdsec CAPI. It does not include any locally banned IP, but can work without a crowdsec service. |
| appsec | Disable Crowdsec IP checking but apply Crowdsec Appsec checking. This mode is intended to be used when Crowdsec IP checking is applied at the Firewall Level. |

The `streaming mode` is recommended for performance, decisions are updated every 60 sec by default and that's the only communication between Traefik and Crowdsec. Every request that happens hits the cache for quick decisions.

The cache can be local to Traefik using the filesystem, or a separate Redis instance.  


## Usage

To get started, use the `docker-compose.yml` file.

You can run it with:
```bash
make run
```

### Note

**/!\ Cache is shared by all services**
*This means if an IP is banned, all services which are protected by an instance of the plugin will deny requests from that IP*
Only one instance of the plugin is *possible*.

#### Fill variable with value of file

`CrowdsecLapiTlsCertificateBouncerKey`, `CrowdsecLapiTlsCertificateBouncer`, `CrowdsecLapiTlsCertificateAuthority`, `CrowdsecCapiMachineId`, `CrowdsecCapiPassword` and `CrowdsecLapiKey` can be provided with the content as raw or through a file path that Traefik can read.  
The file variable will be used as preference if both content and file are provided for the same variable.

Format is:  
- Content: VariableName: XXX
- File   : VariableNameFile: /path

#### Authenticate with LAPI

You can authenticate to the LAPI either with LAPIKEY or by using client certificates.  
Please see below for more details on each option.

#### Generate LAPI KEY
You can generate a crowdsec API key for the LAPI.  
You can follow the documentation here: [docs.crowdsec.net/docs/user_guides/lapi_mgmt](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/user_guides/lapi_mgmt)

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up -d crowdsec
docker exec crowdsec cscli bouncers add crowdsecBouncer
```

This LAPI key must be set where is noted FIXME-LAPI-KEY in the docker-compose.yml
```yaml
...
whoami:
  labels:
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.crowdsec.plugin.bouncer.crowdseclapikey=FIXME-LAPI-KEY"
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.crowdsec.plugin.bouncer.crowdseclapischeme=http"
    - "traefik.http.middlewares.crowdsec.plugin.bouncer.crowdseclapihost=crowdsec:8080"
...
crowdsec:
  environment:
    BOUNCER_KEY_TRAEFIK: FIXME-LAPI-KEY
...
```

Note:
> Crowdsec does not require a specific format for la LAPI-key, you may use something like FIXME-LAPI-KEY but that is not recommanded for obvious reasons

You can then run all the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Use certificates to authenticate with CrowdSec

You can follow the example in `examples/tls-auth` to view how to authenticate with client certificates with the LAPI.  
In that case, communications with the LAPI must go through HTTPS.

A script is available to generate certificates in `examples/tls-auth/gencerts.sh` and must be in the same directory as the inputs for the PKI creation.

#### Use HTTPS to communicate with the LAPI

To communicate with the LAPI in HTTPS you need to either accept any certificates by setting the `crowdsecLapiTLSInsecureVerify` to true or add the CA used by the server certificate of Crowdsec using `crowdsecLapiTLSCertificateAuthority` or `crowdsecLapiTLSCertificateAuthorityFile`.
Set the `crowdsecLapiScheme` to https.

Crowdsec must be listening in HTTPS for this to work.
Please see the [tls-auth example](https://github.com/maxlerebourg/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin/blob/main/examples/tls-auth/README.md) or the official documentation: [docs.crowdsec.net/docs/local_api/tls_auth/](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/local_api/tls_auth/)

#### Manually add an IP to the blocklist (for testing purposes)

```bash
docker-compose up -d crowdsec
docker exec crowdsec cscli decisions add --ip 10.0.0.10 -d 10m # this will be effective 10min
docker exec crowdsec cscli decisions remove --ip 10.0.0.10
```

### Examples

#### 1. Behind another proxy service (ex: clouflare) [examples/behind-proxy/README.md](https://github.com/maxlerebourg/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin/blob/main/examples/behind-proxy/README.md)

#### 2. With Redis as an external shared cache [examples/redis-cache/README.md](https://github.com/maxlerebourg/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin/blob/main/examples/redis-cache/README.md)

#### 3. Using Trusted IP (ex: LAN OR VPN) that won't get filtered by crowdsec [examples/trusted-ips/README.md](https://github.com/maxlerebourg/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin/blob/main/examples/trusted-ips/README.md)

#### 4. Using Crowdsec and Traefik installed as binary in a single VM [examples/binary-vm/README.md](https://github.com/maxlerebourg/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin/blob/main/examples/binary-vm/README.md)

#### 5. Using https communication and tls authentication with Crowdsec [examples/tls-auth/README.md](https://github.com/maxlerebourg/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin/blob/main/examples/tls-auth/README.md)

#### 6. Using Crowdsec and Traefik in Kubernetes [examples/kubernetes/README.md](https://github.com/maxlerebourg/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin/blob/main/examples/kubernetes/README.md)

#### 7. Using Traefik in standalone mode without Crowdsec [examples/standalone-mode/README.md](https://github.com/maxlerebourg/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin/blob/main/examples/standalone-mode/README.md)


#### 8. Using Traefik with AppSec feature enabled [examples/appsec-enabled/README.md](https://github.com/maxlerebourg/crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin/blob/main/examples/appsec-enabled/README.md)


### Local Mode

Traefik also offers a developer mode that can be used for temporary testing of plugins not hosted on GitHub.
To use a plugin in local mode, the Traefik static configuration must define the module name (as is usual for Go packages) and a path to a [Go workspace](https://golang.org/doc/gopath_code.html#Workspaces), which can be the local GOPATH or any directory.

The plugins must be placed in the `./plugins-local` directory,
which should be in the working directory of the process running the Traefik binary.
The source code of the plugin should be organized as follows:

```
./plugins-local/
    └── src
        └── github.com
            └── maxlerebourg
                └── crowdsec-bouncer-traefik-plugin
                    ├── bouncer.go
                    ├── bouncer_test.go
                    ├── go.mod
                    ├── LICENSE
                    ├── Makefile
                    ├── readme.md
                    └── vendor/* 
```

For local development, a `docker-compose.local.yml` is provided which reproduces the directory layout needed by Traefik.  
This works once you have generated and filled your *LAPI-KEY* (crowdsecLapiKey), if not read above for informations.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d
```
Equivalent to
```bash
make run_local
```

### About

[mathieuHa](https://github.com/mathieuHa) and [I](https://github.com/maxlerebourg) have been using Traefik since 2020 at [Primadviz](https://primadviz.com).
We come from a web development and security engineer background and wanted to add the power of a very promising technology (Crowdsec) to the edge router we love.  

We initially ran into this project: [github.com/fbonalair/traefik-crowdsec-bouncer](https://github.com/fbonalair/traefik-crowdsec-bouncer)
It was using traefik and forward auth middleware to verify every request.  
They had to go through a webserver which then contacts another webservice (the crowdsec LAPI) to make a decision based on the source IP.  
We initially proposed some improvements by implementing a streaming mode and a local cache.  
With the Traefik hackathon we decided to implement our solution directly as a Traefik plugin which could be found by everyone on [plugins.traefik.io](https://plugins.traefik.io) and be more performant.
